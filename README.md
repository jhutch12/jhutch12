### Hey y'all ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Jonathan Hutchins, I'm just a young guy trying to work towards his bachelor's degree in IT. I've been fiddling and playing with computers for as long as I remember,
 so this was an easy major to choose! So far I've got a foundation in Python and Java and am about to learn a bit of C# and PHP in the near future, which I'm super excited for.
 I'm an avid gamer, I love all games from racing and sports to mmorpg's and FPS's -- my personal (and life-long) favorite being Halo: Combat Evolved. 
 
  I look forward to sharing my journey to becoming a full-fledged computer connoisseur and am looking forward to any help or feedback in the near future.
